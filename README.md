# moving_edge_tracking

1. Use lightness to track the moving straight edge. Utilize search on the norm direction and local convolutional calculation. I refered to the following papers on the Internet
- A maximum likelihood framework for determining moving edges, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/24782
- https://github.com/lagadic/visp

2. Usage: python track.py -v test1.mp4,  need mouse pick up two points on the edge for the initial frame
